I would very much welcome opinions or contributions for further
extension of this project. The <strong><a href="https://github.com/x77f/ttable" target="_blank">source code</a></strong> is MIT Licensed,

And as far as I can recall, you don't need to worry about mentioning
my name at all. It's given away, it's just a learning material. I'm
no professional programmer. That's why I only went for the minimum
viable product, investing an entire night of my winter vacation. Yes,
I'm terrible when it comes to CSS. Thanks for taking a look! üòÅ
